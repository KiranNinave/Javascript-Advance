// key features for functional programming
// 1. one task ( function should always perform only one task)
// 2. return statement ( function should always return something)
// 3. Pure ( function should always be pure function)
// 4. No share state ( function should not affect the global objects )
// 5. Immutable State ( no share state with other functions)
// 6. Commposable ( function should be easely composable)
// 7. Predictable ( we should predict what function can do)

// function programming are great when we have to maintain parallelism
// function programming are great when it's come to distrubuted system that accessing same data
// if we follow all the key features of functional programming it cause less side effects on data when we have to maintain parallelism
// the key feature is that each function perform own task without effecting data :)
// multiple system accessing data at same time can cause side effects and bugs ( functional programming avoids it using its key features)
