// organizing code into units is called object oriented programming
// avoiding side effects and writing pure function is called functional programming

// in object oriented programming the object contain information(state) and opertions(methods) that are group together
// in functional programming it contain functions and data wich is immutable( not change ), it contains pure functions

// in object oriented programming objects are first class citiezens
// in functional programming functions are first class citiezens

// bothe are them have same goal but they structuring things differently
// its totatly depends on the project wich to use

// functional programming is performing many operations on fixed data
// object oriented programming is performing few operations on common data

// function programming is stateless ( we dont modify the state)
// object oriented programming is statefull (we modify the state)

// in functional programming functions are pure (have no side effect outside the function)
// in object oriented programming function have side effects ( can modify objects data)

// in functional programming writing parallel code become easy
// in object oriented programming have some diffeculties

// functional programming is more declerative (what to do)
// object oriented programming is more imerative (how to do)

// functional programming is best when we want to handle large data because we can use multiple processors ( machine learning)
// object oriented programming is best when we have many things( data fields) but less operations

// functional programming seperates data and behaviour
// object oriented programming combine data and behaviour

// but we can combine both to write more powefull code :)
