// there are some caseses where composition is better solution than inheritance
// but there are also cases that inheritance is batter than composition

// the major problems with composition is that tight coupling
// if we modify base class it will refect to all the classes below even if we did't want it on some classes

// we can overcome this problem using composition beacuse we can add function's in composition without affecting other

// inheritance -> what is it
// composition -> what is has

// in javascript lot of programmers prefer composition over inheritance
